## What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for a wide range of operating systems. It was developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Since then it has evolved into one of the most powerful OS available. By open-source we mean that users can view, modify, and distribute the source code freely, which is unlike other common OS like Windows and macOS.

The Linux model is built with an emphasis on collaboration, making it easier for contributors worldwide to contribute to its improvement. Although you may not have interacted with the OS directly, you might have interacted with devices that are powered by Linux, a good example of this is Android devices.

Characteristics of Linux

- Open-source - its open-source nature means the source code is accessible to anyone to contribute, modify, and share the code.
- Reliable - its stability and reliable nature make it the perfect choice for critical systems and servers.
- Multitasking and multiuser- it supports multiple users making it easier for resource sharing, additionally it makes it easier for users to run multiple processes.
- Security - it has a wide range of security features including user privilege management, file system permissions, and mandatory access controls.
- Portability - its portability nature has led to its wide adoption in diverse environments from embedded systems and smartphones to servers and supercomputers.
- Command-Line Interface (CLI) - it offers a powerful CLI, providing users with extensive control over system functions.

 ## Understanding Directory Hierarchy
In Linux, understanding the directory hierarchy is crucial for efficient navigation and file management. A Linux systemâ€™s directory structure, also known as the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), is a defined tree structure that helps to prevent files from being scattered all over the system and instead organise them in a logical and easy-to-navigate manner.

- /: Root directory, the top level of the file system.
- /home: User home directories.
- /bin: Essential binary executables.
- /sbin: System administration binaries.
- /etc: Configuration files.
- /var: Variable data (logs, spool files).
- /usr: User programs and data.
- /lib: Shared libraries.
- /tmp: Temporary files.
